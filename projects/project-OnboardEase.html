                            <p> To identify pain points in the onboarding process and opportunities to improve the interaction experience, my team created journey maps of the new employee and the manager responsible for training.

                            <p>User journey maps revealed that new employees found onboarding overwhelming due to a lack of a systematic view of their responsibilities.

After defining concrete goals for the workshop, I planned the participatory session with my team. to choose and arrange activities for. Activities were chosen and adapted based on our goals, ranging from role-playing activities, analytical activities and creative activities. I structured the session in a way that the previous activity will prepare the participants for the next activity.

                        <h3>Co-designing as a way to research and innovate</h3>
                        <p>From this project, I not only learned how to plan and run a participatory workshop but also had a taste of co-design methods. Unlike traditional research methods, such as interviews and surveys, the workshop encouraged active stakeholder participation, leading to user-centred and contextually relevant solutions and fostering a sense of ownership and commitment.</p>
 
                        <h3>Consideration of feasibility of design solution</h3>
                        <p>While MeaningfulWork's team expressed their appreciation for our final solution in the exit meeting, my team missed the opportunity to help MeaningfulWork easily adapt our solution. Since what we presented was a mockup and MeaningfulWork did not have the budget to develop such a platform, a substitute approach was needed for them to achieve the same interaction flow. We could have researched existing platforms and designed a minimum viable product that is ready to be used by MeaningfulWork.</p>

                        <p>In my future practice, I would like to consider ways to actively engage my target users and provides opportunities for them to dive into the design problem and create the solution. I will also take my client and target users' capabilities into account when delivering the final solution.</p>
